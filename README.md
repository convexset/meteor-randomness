# Randomness

This Meteor package provides tools for doing stochastic modelling and statistics.
It uses the fast and seedable Alea PRNG (by Johannes Baag√∏e) for uniform variates, and provides tools for generating random variates (uniform, normal, exponential, Poisson, gamma, beta, Dirichlet) and doing Bayesian statistics.
